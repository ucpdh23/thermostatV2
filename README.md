*My Home Automation Bot*

Introduction
-----------------------------

- Do you what to know if everything is in order at home? Servant is your bot.

- Do you what to control your home remotely, switching lights or a boiler on or off? Servant can manage your requests.

- Do you need someone to warn you about the incidents at home? Servant can it for you.

- Do you like to monitor the status of your home? Servant likes to do what for you.

 
Providing a simple interface (xmpp), you can communicate with this bot, in order to 
request actions or to ask questions about your home status

Servant, using some IA techniques, can handle some situations at home or suggest options in order to manage some ordinary operations at home, simplifying life and making the World a better place. 

TODO List:

* Unit test
* Concept of application context and session.
* Concept of automatic operations (for example rss monitoring)

Future work:

* Implement a real IA system, in order to provide an automatic learning system that suggests things from common behaviour.
